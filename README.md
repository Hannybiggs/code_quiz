# Code Quiz

[Check it Out](https://hannybiggs.github.io/code_quiz/)

This application is a simple, timed, multiple-choice quiz which tests the users knowledge of javascript.
This application runs in a browser and uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to dynamically change screens as the user interacts with the quiz. There is a high score page that updates with the local storage.

## Goals:
- Create Multiple choice quiz
- Have scores saved to local storage
- Have a timer that penalizes for incorrect answers
- Have cards be dynamically displayed
- Have an adequately polished UI
- Leave useful comments in the code

## Features:
- High score board
- Clear button
- Back button
- Timer

## Results: 
The simple application is complete and functions as intended. For future improvement, many things could be added to the interface. The UI can have more interactive elements, and the question database can be extended (as it is very short at the moment.)
